## Project Overview

Welcome to Geko, an innovative Sustainable Farming Guidance Platform developed by Team Mugiwara Kaizoku for the Hack@Arch 2023 national level hackathon. Geko is designed to empower farmers in overcoming various challenges they face in agriculture, with a focus on sustainability and productivity.

## Features of Geko:

1. **Personalized Guidance:** Delivers personalized guidance covering a wide range of farming factors.
2. **Sustainable Practices:** Advocates for sustainable practices to ensure long-term productivity and ecological equilibrium of farms.
3. **Soil Management:** Offers expert advice on soil management to preserve and enhance soil health.
4. **Crop Rotation Strategies:** Recommends optimal crop rotation strategies to minimize soil depletion and reduce pests and diseases.
5. **Tailored Crop Recommendations:** Provides crop recommendations tailored to specific soil types, weather conditions, and farmer preferences.
6. **Fertilizer Recommendations:** Offers fertilizer recommendations based on the unique needs of both the soil and crops.
7. **Government Schemes Awareness:** Keeps farmers informed about government schemes that may benefit them economically.
8. **Disease Detection System:** Incorporates a robust disease detection system, along with remedies and treatments for agricultural ailments.
9. **Waste-to-Energy Solutions:** Implements solutions to convert agricultural waste into energy sources, addressing waste management and providing additional income for farmers.

## Goal

Geko is dedicated to assisting farmers in making informed decisions and achieving greater sustainability and productivity in their farming practices. It generates suggestions based on real-time data on location, soil type, nutrient levels, and weather.

## Implementation

Our goal is to create a highly optimized Large Language Model (LLM) specifically tailored to agriculture. We plan to utilize a pre-trained language model as a foundation and fine-tune it for specialized agricultural tasks. The model will be trained on diverse datasets encompassing articles, e-books, Wikipedia entries, crop cycle information, and more.

## Need of Geko

Farmers often face decision-making challenges due to unpredictable weather, limited understanding of soil conditions, and various uncertainties related to farming. Geko addresses these issues comprehensively by leveraging AI-driven solutions and harnessing available data to make sustainable farming accessible to everyone.

It caters to areas facing challenges such as poor soil quality and unpredictable weather patterns, making it highly valuable. Geko also targets a substantial market segment of small-scale farmers by offering affordable and user-friendly solutions.
